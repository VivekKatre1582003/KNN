# KNN
 This script implements the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm using Scikit-learn. It loads the Breast Cancer dataset, which is used for binary classification (malignant vs. benign tumors). The dataset is split into training and testing sets, and a KNN classifier is trained to make predictions based on the nearest neighbors of a data point. ðŸš€
